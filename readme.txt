To run my program you must first "make" to compile the program and then "java GameTester" to start the execution of the program. The program does not take any additional information or command line arguments.

The program only accepts case-sensitive inputs of: "QUIT", "EXIT", "LOOK", "N", "GO N", "S", "GO S", "E", "GO E", "W", "GO W", "U", "GO U", "D", and "GO D". Otherwise and error message will display asking for the useer to try different input.

After you enter a new place you must type "LOOK" in order to receive a description of the place.

I added a spacer function for readability. It adds a line of asterisks in order to break up chunks of information.
